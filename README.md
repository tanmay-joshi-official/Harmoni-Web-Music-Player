# 🎧 Harmoni – Web Music Player

Harmoni is a **Spotify-inspired web music player** built completely using **HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript**. The goal of this project was to deeply understand how a real-world music streaming interface works on the **frontend**, including audio playback, UI state management, and responsive layouts — without using any frameworks or backend services.

This project is designed as a **major frontend learning project** and focuses on clean UI, smooth user interaction, and original branding.

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer**: This project is created strictly for **learning and educational purposes**. All audio used in this project is sourced from **Pixabay (royalty-free music)**.

## 📚 What I Learned

* Building a **large frontend-only application** from scratch
* Using the **HTML5 Audio API** for real-world functionality
* Managing application state (current song, playlist, playback status)
* Structuring JavaScript logic for better readability
* Creating responsive UI components without frameworks
* Handling assets and relative paths correctly
* Branding a project professionally for public sharing

## 🚧 Known Limitations

* This is a **frontend-only** project
* No user authentication or personalization
* Playlists are dynamically loaded using the songs folder through localhost
* No backend or database integration

These limitations are intentional to keep the focus on frontend development.

* Integrate a backend for dynamic content
* Improve accessibility (ARIA roles, keyboard navigation)
* Add theme customization
